    Update the Process1 method to catch the exception that's thrown in the WriteMessage method.
    The Process1 method should print the following message to console when the exception is caught:
    "Exception caught in Process1"

    Don't change any code outside the Process1 method.

    When you run your updated application, it should generate the following output:
    "∞
    Exception caught in Process1
    Exit program"
